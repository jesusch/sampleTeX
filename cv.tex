% Work Experience
\section{Work Experience}
\noindent\textsc{Jun 2018 - present} \textbf{Software Developer}
at \textsc{Mercurytide}, Edinburgh\\
A back-end web development role utilising Django and either PostgreSQL or MySQL. When the requirements cannot be met with just Django, I occasionally use JavaScript and libraries such as Bootstrap/jQuery to ensure functionality meets the criteria. Certain projects use RESTful APIs. I have used Docker, Python virtual environments and VMs to maintain consistent environments between development and deployment. I work closely together with my team, using git and BitBucket for version control.\\
We use Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Sprint to set goals and remain reactive to clients' needs. Support tickets and Sprint stories are managed using JIRA.\\
We have internal libraries and tools that require frequent maintenance. Some clients may also be on older versions of Python/Django if they have been with us for a long time. On occasion older versions of libraries need to be patched with updates from later versions at the client's request. I was responsible for writing the GDPR updates to our Mailout library on Django 1.11, and then backporting these updates to both Django 1.10 and Django 1.5.\\
I inherited the lead developer role on a large project after another developer had left the company. The project was relatively mature but still had several development phases to complete. I coordinated with the business analysts in planning the project's sprints and stories. I would occasionally create my own tickets on JIRA and delegate tasks to other developers.
