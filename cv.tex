% Work Experience
\section{Work Experience}
\noindent\textsc{Aug 2019 - Present} \textbf{Software Developer}
at \textsc{TVSquared}, Edinburgh\\
Back end web development role with a focus on big data and performance. Producing software for a number of high profile clients. The technology stack is based loosely on Django but uses custom functionality that was written in-house.\\ 
My role involves creating custom functionality for our in-house distributed processing system. This requires close attention to detail and an understanding of how functionality can scale to encompass large datasets. I use Spark to improve performance for large or critical jobs. Data are often being read or written from multiple sources between PostgreSQL, AWS S3 and MongoDB.\\
I often need to spend time analysing data sets to ensure that they are consistent after code changes.\\
We operate on three week sprints with a ``chill'' and release in the last week.  Tasks are discussed in daily scrums and we use Phabricator for handling tickets/projects.\\\\
\noindent\textsc{Jun 2018 - Aug 2019} \textbf{Software Developer}
at \textsc{Mercurytide}, Edinburgh\\
Full stack web development role using Django. I often used JavaScript and libraries such as Bootstrap/jQuery. Some projects involved RESTful APIs. I used various methods of maintaining consistent environments between development and production such Docker, virtual environments and VMs\\
We had daily scrums to remain reactive to clients' needs and some projects had sprints lasting two weeks. Tickets and sprint stories were managed using JIRA.\\
